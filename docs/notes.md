# Session notes

Append a dated entry per session. Never rewrite old ones.

Done:
- #2 alert levels, #4 sensors + status line, #5 ESP forwarding: code merged, all checks green. Each issue stays open until its manual hardware check passes.
- Laptop toolchain: gh, arduino-cli 1.5.1 with cores arduino:avr 1.8.8 and esp8266:esp8266 3.1.2, libraries "DHT sensor library", "Adafruit Unified Sensor", LiquidCrystal (#8 needs it; the IDE bundles it, arduino-cli does not).

Decisions:
- Seat baseline is taken only at power-up. No auto-retry: a retry could learn an occupied seat as empty. While there is no baseline the LED shows the seat fault code and USB Serial repeats a "#" line; recovery is a power cycle with the seat empty.
- Humidity repeats the last good DHT11 value for up to 30 s, then sends the 0 placeholder.
- ESP forwards only the newest complete line, POST timeout 300 ms (worst case about 1.2 s, under the 2 s period). ECHO_SERVER_URL must be http://<IPv4>:<port>/status; a hostname is refused.

Open questions for Eve:
- Make `humidity` nullable (doc change, server/status.js accepts null, sketch sends null instead of 0)?
- Add the magenta seat fault code to the LED table in docs/firmware.md.

Next session starts with hardware:
1. RGB LED was wired to D9/D10/D11; moved to D44/D45/D46 per the pin map (common cathode). Re-check before power-up.
2. Upload firmware/mega (`arduino-cli upload -p /dev/cu.usbmodem14201 --fqbn arduino:avr:mega firmware/mega`, run by a person), seat empty, ignition jumper in. Run the #4 manual check (status lines, sensors, OCCUPANT under 45 s, cancel, ignition, seat fault on power-up with the ultrasonic unplugged) and the #8 LED, buzzer and LCD checks.
3. The ESP did not show up as a USB port: check its USB cable carries data and install the CH340/CP2102 driver if needed. Then fill firmware/esp/secrets.h (laptop IPv4 on the hotspot), upload with the ESP RX wire unplugged, and run the #5 manual check (a POST every 2 s, recovery after the hotspot drops).
